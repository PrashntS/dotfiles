Useless (and useful!) stuffs I do to my terminal.

- `jupyter/custom.css`: A Dark `Jupyter` custom theme.
- `etc/looks.wtf.go`: Emoticon Generator! Written in Go for quick emote generation. Build the binary using `go build looks.wtf.go` and put it somewhere in your path. Run `looks.wtf` and Wow. I use it for my terminal's login messages.
